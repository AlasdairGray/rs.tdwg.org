acceptedNameUsage,Accepted Name Usage,,,Nom valide,,,,,,"The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known, of the accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) name in cases where the provided scientificName is considered by the reference indicated in the accordingTo property, or of the content provider, to be a synonym or misapplied name. When applied to an Organism or Occurrence, this term should be used in cases where a content provider regards the provided scientificName to be inconsistent with the taxonomic perspective of the content provider. For example, there are many discrepancies within specimen collections and observation datasets between the recorded name (e.g., the most recent identification from an expert who examined a specimen, or a field identification for an observed organism), and the name asserted by the content provider to be taxonomically accepted.",,,,,,,,
