scientificName,Scientific Name,,,,,,,,,"This term should not contain identification qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the IdentificationQualifier term. When applied to an Organism or Occurrence, this term should be used to represent the scientific name that was applied to the associated Organism in accordance with the Taxon to which it was or is currently identified. Names should be compliant to the most recent nomenclatural code. For example, names of hybrids for algae, fungi and plants should follow the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Schenzhen Code Articles H.1, H.2 and H.3). Thus, use the multiplication sign `×` (Unicode `U+00D7`, HTML `&times;`) to identify a hybrid, not `x` or `X`, if possible.",,,,,,,,
