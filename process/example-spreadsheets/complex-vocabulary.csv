language,Language,A language of the resource.,Language(s) of resource itself represented in the ISO639-2 three-letter language code. ISO639-1 two-letter codes are permitted but deprecated.,"An image may contain language such as superimposed labels. If an image is of a natural scene or organism, without any language included, the resource is language-neutral (ISO code ""zxx""). Resources with present but unknown language are to be coded as undetermined (ISO code ""und""). Regional dialects or other special cases should conform to the ISO639-5 Alpha-3 Code for Language Families and Groups, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-5.html, where possible or the IETF Best Practices for Tags Identifying Languages, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646, where not.

type,Type,The nature or genre of the resource.,"The value of dc:type SHOULD be a term name of any term from the DCMI Type Vocabulary, https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#section-7 RECOMMENDED term names for media items are ""Collection"", ""StillImage"", ""Sound"", ""MovingImage"", ""InteractiveResource"", and ""Text"". A Collection MUST be given a value of ""Collection"". Following the DC recommendations at http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text, images of text SHOULD be given a value of ""Text"" for dc:type. A value for at least one of dc:type and dcterms:type MUST be supplied in an Audubon Core record but when feasible, supplying both can make the metadata more widely useful. The values of dc:type and dcterms:type SHOULD designate the same type, but in case of ambiguity dcterms:type prevails.","If the resource is a Collection, this term does not identify what types of objects it may contain. See also the entry for dcterms:type in the Audubon Core term list document and see the DCMI FAQ on DC and DCTERMS Namespaces, https://web.archive.org/web/20171126043657/https://github.com/dcmi/repository/blob/master/mediawiki_wiki/FAQ/DC_and_DCTERMS_Namespaces.md, for discussion of the rationale for terms in two namespaces.

CreateDate,Original Date and Time,"The date and time the resource was created. For a digital file, this need not match a file-system creation time. For a freshly created resource, it should be close to that time, modulo the time taken to write the file. Later file transfer, copying, and so on, can make the file-system time arbitrarily different.","The date of the creation of the original resource from which the digital media was derived or created. The date and time MUST comply with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) datetime practice, https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, which requires that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html. AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus (""forward slash"", '/').","What constitutes ""original"" is determined by the metadata author. Example: Digitization of a photographic slide of a map would normally give the date at which the map was created; however a photographic work of art including the same map as its content may give the date of the original photographic exposure. Imprecise or unknown dates can be represented as ISO dates or ranges. Compare also Date and Time Digitized in the Resource Creation Vocabulary. See also the wikipedia IS0 8601 entry, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601, for further explanation and examples.",,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://purl.org/dc/terms/PeriodOfTime,No
MetadataDate,Metadata Date,The date and time that any metadata for this resource was last changed. It should be the same as or more recent than xmp:ModifyDate.,"Point in time recording when the last modification to metadata (not necessarily the media object itself) occurred. The date and time MUST comply with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) datetime practice, https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, which requires that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year fields always comprising 4 digits.

AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus (""forward slash"", '/').","This is not dcterms:modified, which refers to the resource itself rather than its metadata.
