subtype,Subtype (IRI),"A class, represented by an IRI, that provides for more specialization of the media item type than dcterms:type.","The subtype term MUST NOT be applied to Collection objects. However, the Description term in the Content Coverage Vocabulary might add further description to a Collection object.
