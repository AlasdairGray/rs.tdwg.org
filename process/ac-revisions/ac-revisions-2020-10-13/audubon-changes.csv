resourceCreationTechnique,Resource Creation Technique,"Information about technical aspects of the creation and digitization process of the resource. This includes modification steps (""retouching"") after the initial resource capture.",,"Annotating whether and how a resource has been modified or edited significantly in ways that are not immediately obvious to, or expected by, consumers is of special significance. Examples for images are: Removing a distracting twig from a picture, moving an object to a different surrounding, changing the color in parts of the image, or blurring the background of an image. Modifications that are standard practice and expected or obvious are not necessary to document; examples of such practices include changing resolution, cropping, minor sharpening or overall color correction, and clearly perceptible modifications (e.g., addition of arrows or labels, or the placement of multiple pictures into a table.) If it is only known that significant modifications were made, but no details are known, a general statement like ""Media may have been manipulated to improve appearance"" may be appropriate. See also Subject Preparation Technique.","Encoding method or settings, numbers of channels, lighting, frames per second, data rate, interlaced or progressive, multiflash lighting, remote control, automatic interval exposure.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/ResourceCreation,,,No,No
subtype,Subtype (IRI),"A class, represented by an IRI, that provides for more specialization of the media item type than dcterms:type.","The subtype term MUST NOT be applied to Collection objects. However, the Description term in the Content Coverage Vocabulary might add further description to a Collection object. IRI values SHOULD be selected from the Controlled Vocabulary for Audubon Core subtype. In text-based systems such as tables, IRI values MUST be in unabbreviated form. When an appropriate subtype is not available in the Audubon Core controlled vocabulary, a term IRI that is not in a TDWG namespace MAY be used.
