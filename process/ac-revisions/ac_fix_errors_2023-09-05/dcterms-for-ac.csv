format,Format (IRI),"The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource. ",An IRI denoting the technical format of the resource (file format or physical medium).

Human-readable information about the Controlled Vocabulary for format is at http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/format/ .,"In cases where an IRI for the format does not exist in the controlled vocabulary, a provider can omit this property and provide a media type or file extension value for dc:format.

language,Language,A language of the resource. ,"URI from the ISO639-2 list of URIs for ISO 3-letter language codes, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2.","An image may contain language such as superimposed labels. If an image is of a natural scene or organism, without any language included, the resource is language-neutral with URI http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/zxx corresponding to ISO ISO639-2 code ""zxx"". Resources with present but unknown language are to be coded as undetermined, with URI http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/und corresponding to ISO639-2 code ""und"". Regional dialects or other special cases should conform to the ISO639-5 Alpha-3 Code for Language Families and Groups, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-5.html, where possible or the IETF Best Practices for Tags Identifying Languages, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646, where not.

rights,Copyright Statement,Information about rights held in and over the resource.,"A URI pointing to structured information about rights held in and over the resource. At least one of dcterms:rights and dc:rights MUST be supplied but, when feasible, supplying both might make the metadata more widely useful. They MUST specify the same rights.

source,Published Source,A related resource from which the described resource is derived. ,URI for an identifiable source from which the described resources was derived.,"If the resource was digitized from a non-digital resource, or was also previously published in a digital or printed publication, this describes the original. If a string is required for this, use dc:source. Do not put generally ""related"" publications in here. A URI that can be resolved and dereferenced to provide a description of the source resource may also be used here. For example, ""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1998021539/PP/"" is the address of a web page that provides a description the original negative of a famous picture by the photographer Dorothea Lange and so would be an appropriate value of dcterms:source. The term may be repeatable if a montage of images. Information about further provenance beyond the ultimate source should be put in the derivedFrom attribute.

type,Type,The nature or genre of the resource. ,"The value of dcterms:type SHOULD be an IRI of any term from the DCMI Type Vocabulary, https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#section-7 . In text-based systems (e.g. spreadsheets) the value MUST be an IRI with an unabbreviated namespace. Machine-readable systems MAY use any form of the IRI (e.g. compact URIs; CURIEs) that can be determined to be equivalent to the unabbreviated IRI. RECOMMENDED values for media items are those IRIs whose term names are ""Collection"", ""StillImage"", ""Sound"", ""MovingImage"", ""InteractiveResource"", and ""Text"". A Collection MUST be given a value of http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection. Following the DC recommendations at http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text, images of text SHOULD be given a value of http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text for dcterms:type. A value for at least one of dc:type and dcterms:type MUST be supplied in an Audiovisual Core record but when feasible, supplying both can make the metadata more widely useful. The values of dc:type and dcterms:type SHOULD designate the same type, but in case of ambiguity dcterms:type prevails.","If the resource is a Collection, this term does not identify what types of objects it may contain.
