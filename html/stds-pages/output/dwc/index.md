title: Darwin Core
summary: Darwin Core is a standard maintained by the [Darwin Core maintenance group](../../community/dwc). It includes a glossary of terms intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

## Maintenance group

Modifications and enhancements to Darwin Core are managed by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](../../community/dwc).

The best way to be involved is to create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com), and "watch" the [Darwin Core GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc), as well as the [Darwin Core Questions & Answers repository](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-qa), and respond to requests for comments or "issues" ([Darwin Core issues](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues) and [Darwin Core QA issues](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-qa/issues/)). Information about how to suggest changes to the standard can be found at the [Guidelines for Contributing](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

## Scope of Darwin Core

What is in scope?

- Collections of any kind of biological objects or data.
- Terminology associated with biological collection data.
- Striving for compatibility with other biodiversity-related standards.
- Facilitating the addition of components and attributes of biological data.

What is not in scope?

- Data interchange protocols.
- Non-biodiversity-related data.
- Purely taxonomic data.

## Audience

- Biodiversity data holders (organizations, institutions, researchers).
- Consumers of biodiversity data.
- Developers of collections management systems.
- Other TDWG interest and task groups.
- Protocol developers (TAPIR).
- Biodiversity network developers.

**Abstract:** This guide is intended to facilitate the use of Darwin Core terms in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It explains basic features of RDF and provides details of how to expose data in the form of RDF using Darwin Core terms and terms from other key vocabularies. It defines terms in the namespace http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/iri/ which are intended for use excusively with non-literal objects. \

**Abstract:** All terms in the Darwin Core must be assigned a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For convenience, the term URIs that are assigned and managed by the Darwin Core Task Group are grouped into collections known as Darwin Core namespaces. This document describes how term URIs are allocated by the Darwin Core Task Group and the policies associated with Darwin Core namespaces. \
