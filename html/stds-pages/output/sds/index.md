title: TDWG Standards Documentation Standard
summary: The TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS) consists of a single document: the [Standards Documentation Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/sds/documentation-specification.md). That document defines how TDWG standards are to be presented. It provides details about the hierarchical structure of standards and versioning of standards components. It specifies how the properties of standards and their components are to be described in human-readable and machine-readable terms.

## Maintenance group

Audubon Core is maintained by a specialized Interest Group whose [charter](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/audubon-core_maintenance-group_charter.md) was approved in January 2018. The functions of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in [Section 2 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#2-administration). In brief, the Maintenance Group manages vocabulary term additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard. As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard.

The activities of the AC Maintenance Group are documented at the group's Github repository, <https://github.com/tdwg/ac>, where a current list of core members and their contact information can be found.  Community participation is welcome.  If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members.  

To participate in the communications of the group, "watch" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues).  This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group.
