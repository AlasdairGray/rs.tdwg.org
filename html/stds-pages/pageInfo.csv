The functions of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in [Section 2 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#2-administration). In brief, the Maintenance Group manages vocabulary term additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard. As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard.

The activities of the AC Maintenance Group are documented at the group's Github repository, <https://github.com/tdwg/ac>, where a current list of core members and their contact information can be found.  Community participation is welcome.  If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members.  

To participate in the communications of the group, ""watch"" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues).  This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group."

Since 1998 the database of author names and their standard forms (which formed the basis of the Brummitt & Powell's (1992) Authors of Plant Names) has been maintained and updated on line as part of the Plant Names Project. This database represents a significant improvement to the static one which was hitherto available on our website since it is continuously updated with new entries and additions/corrections to existing entries. Names are still standardized according to the Brummitt & Powell rules; and you can now find authors in the [International Plant Names Index (IPNI) database](https://www.ipni.org/).

## Authors of Plant Names and TDWG

The Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) adopted the original printed version of Brummitt & Powell (1992) as their data standard for Authors of Plant Names. The adoption of the current live database is still currently under discussion. This would represent a new precedent for TDWG in that all standards adopted to date have been static and in hard copy."

[DiGIR](http://www.digir.net/) and [BioCASe](http://www.biocase.org/products/protocols/) are alternative protocols developed to access historical data from geographically distributed biological collections. While DiGIR and BioCASe have been successful in their own domains, incompatibilities between them make the exchange of biodiversity data more complex than it should be. TAPIR, the TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval, is an international project to solve this problem and to add new functionality.

## How TAPIR works

A TAPIR network comprises distributed data providers with different database systems and different data structures, but all of them having the same kind of content. Consider a group of natural history museums that want to make their biological specimen data available from a single Web search page. Each organization has its own database in a different computer environment. For example, some may use a commercial collection management software, others may use an open source software environment, or even just a simple spreadsheet. Their common requirement is for all searches via a single Web page to access all databases and produce a combined and integrated response to the searcher.

Since all databases contain the same kind of content, it is therefore possible to define what is called a data abstraction layer. DarwinCore is an example of a data abstraction layer for biodiversity data. DarwinCore specifies the details of a specimen or observation of a specimen, such as the name of the organism, where, when and by whom it was collected. TAPIR works with one or more of these data abstraction layers to make it appear to the searcher that all the separate databases are like one big integrated database.

The data providers usually don't need to change their databases nor to periodically export their data. Instead, they will typically install a 'wrapper' software application and then configure it in a way that each concept from the data abstraction layer corresponds to a particular field in their own databases.

This wrapper receives the remote TAPIR search request, translates it into the local language and data structure, applies it to the database, and then sends back a TAPIR search response to the searcher.

TAPIR is flexible enough to be used in a wide range of applications. Other examples include harvesting data to build a central database, sharing data using different Web formats (e.g. RSS, RDF or KML) or building Web interfaces to help browse or search any database.

## TAPIR's key features

- integrates well with the Web infrastructure because it is based on established international Web standards like HTTP, XML and XML Schema.
- is independent of the data being exchanged and therefore can be used to access a wide range of data.
- can return data in many different formats - search responses are flexible and customizable.
- includes five operations to cover all necessary aspects for searching and retrieving data in a network: access to metadata (descriptive data) and capabilities of the provider, preliminary data discovery and data mining, searching, and monitoring the data provider service.
- allows all operations to be invoked through simple Web addresses.
- supports complex requests.
- has existing TAPIR wrapper applications including PyWrapper, TapirLink and TapirDotNET.

TDWG vocabularies are a collection of standardized terms and their definitions. Vocabulary standards differ from other Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) standards in that they are likely to change more often over time as they evolve to meet the changing needs of the biodiversity informatics community. These changes may be incremental, making it impractical to apply the full [TDWG standards process](../../about/process) to every change. The TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification details the categories of changes that can be made to a TDWG vocabulary standard, the mechanisms used to achieve those changes, and the entities that are responsible for shepherding those changes through the process.

## Audience

This standard is intended for those who are involved in making changes to TDWG vocabulary standards. That includes those who want to submit change proposals and members of Interest Groups who are responsible for vocabulary maintenance."
